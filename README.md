Play War...
Sam and Corey are the contributors...

   The purpose of this code is to simulate the card game, War. It starts out by dealing half the deck(26 cards) to each player. From there each player plays 1 card each, with the bigger of the two gaining the cards played. If the two players have the same card, then that becomes War, and each player puts down 4 cards. With the help from pyglet, we are able show that actual cards that are put down during the game. Pyglet will bring up a window showing the cards while a keypress is allowing it to show one turn of the game. We also took are card images from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_playing_cards for our game. We added pyglet into are github because it is needed to get the finished product.

   To run the program, run the setup for pyglet. Then you can run the code using your terminal and textwrangler. The output of the function brings up a windo with your cards laying face down. Then every key you press brings up one turn of the first round. Two cards on the screen shows that you did not have to war while 8 cards on the screen shows when you war with the lowest face up card showing your two new cards you need to compare to see who wins the war and the cards of that turn. At the end the person who adds up their pile and has the most cards or if there is a tie after round 1 will show on the screen with the first line of text. Disregard if there is a second line.
