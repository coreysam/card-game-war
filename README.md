Sam and Corey are the contributors
The purpose of this code is to simulate the card game, War. It starts out by dealing half the deck(26 cards) to each player. From there each player plays 1 card each, with the bigger of the two gaining the card. If the two players have the same card, then that becomes War, and each player puts down 4 cards. With the help from pyglet, we are able show that acutal cards that are put down during the game.
