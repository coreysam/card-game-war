Play War...
Sam and Corey are the contributors...

   The purpose of this code is to simulate the card game, War. It starts out by dealing half the deck(26 cards) to each player. From there each player plays 1 card each, with the bigger of the two gaining the cards played. If the two players have the same card, then that becomes War, and each player puts down 4 cards. With the help from pyglet, we are able show that acutal cards that are put down during the game. Pyglet will bring up a window showing the cards while a keypress is allowing it to show one turn of the game.
